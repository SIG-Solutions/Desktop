          <h2>We take responsibility for outcomes, not activities.</h2>
          <p>
            LeadLabs is a GTM studio. We help businesses turn demand into revenue through conversion-first execution.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're not a marketing agency. We don't sell hours or impressions or "brand awareness." We build systems that convert — then we optimize them until they scale.
          </p>

        <div class="about-section">
          <h2>How we work</h2>
          <p>
            We work hands-on. No junior account managers. No outsourced execution. When you work with LeadLabs, you work with the people doing the work.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're a small team by design. This means we can only take on a handful of clients at any time. We'd rather do exceptional work for a few than mediocre work for many.
          </p>
          <p>
            We focus on what actually moves revenue: offer design, funnel architecture, paid acquisition, and conversion optimization. If it doesn't contribute to growth, we don't do it.
          </p>

          <h2>What we believe</h2>
          <ul class="beliefs">
            <li>
              <strong>Proof over explanation.</strong> Show the work, don't describe it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Conversion mechanics over vibes.</strong> Every element earns its place.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Systems over tactics.</strong> Individual optimizations fail without systemic thinking.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Outcomes over activities.</strong> We measure what matters: revenue.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Who's behind this</h2>
          <p>
            LeadLabs was founded by someone who got tired of watching businesses waste money on marketing that doesn't convert. After years of building GTM systems — first in-house, then for clients — the pattern became clear: most growth problems are conversion problems dressed up as traffic problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            We built LeadLabs to fix that. One business at a time.

title: "Traffic Doesn't Fix Broken GTM"
excerpt: "Buying more traffic into a broken system just accelerates loss."

When growth stalls, the instinct is to buy more traffic. Run more ads. Try a new channel. Get more eyeballs on the problem.

This almost never works.

If your funnel converts at 1% and you double traffic, you still convert at 1%. You just paid twice as much to learn that lesson. Traffic is an accelerant. It amplifies whatever system it enters. If the system is broken, traffic accelerates your losses.

The question isn't "how do we get more traffic?" It's "why isn't our current traffic converting?" Until you answer that, more traffic is just more expensive data collection.

We've taken over accounts spending six figures monthly on ads that weren't working. The first thing we do is cut spend. Not because we're trying to save money, but because pouring fuel on a broken engine just creates a bigger fire.

Fix the system first. Traffic comes after.
